# R Shiny Lab Information Management System

Shiny application that functions as the user interface of a LIMS. By creating our own system, we create a more flexible, personalized, and significantly cheaper alternative to commercially available LIMS. Modules are designed to make sample storage, tracking, and management simple and strive to introduce as little human error as possible. Data is stored within REDCap and accessed via API. Automated tests are implemented to ensure updates do not produce unintended consequences.
